# b2d
The b2d project provides modern builds of versions of bmp2dhr, a utility for converting modern graphics to Apple II graphics.  

# Releases
- see the releases page

# Usage

The `b2d` command will show a small amount of help upon execution without any arguments. 

Here's an example of converting a BMP to a LoRes Apple II screen:

`b2d myimage.bmp L N`

The `L` is for LoRes output, and the `N` specifies to not include any header, just the raw image data.
